Clinical Trials Success & Dropout Analysis
==========================================
------------------------------------------

########################################################################
Welcome to the *Clinical Trials Success and Dropout Analysis* repository

This project is a in-depth exploration of the factors influencing the success and discontinuation of clinical trials. This work blends **healthcare analytics** and **data visualization** to uncover insights that can improve research efficiency, patient retention, and overall trial success.

----------------
Project Overview
----------------  
This project analyzes data from **ClinicalTrials.gov**, focusing on **oncology** and **immunotherapy (Pembrolizumab – Keytruda)** studies conducted across the United States.  
Using **Python**, **Excel**, and **Power BI**, it investigates trial completion rates, dropout patterns, sponsor performance, and duration trends to understand what drives successful clinical outcomes.

----------
Objectives
----------
The main objectives of this project are:  

- Assess success and dropout rates across different clinical trial phases.  
- Identify major factors influencing trial completion.  
- Evaluate sponsor performance and operational efficiency.  
- Analyze trial duration and its impact on patient retention.  
- Present insights through clear, interactive visualizations.

-----------------
Expected Outcomes
-----------------
Upon completing this project, the following outcomes are expected:  

- Insight into trends of completed vs. discontinued trials.  
- Identification of sponsors and phases with the highest success rates.  
- Data-driven strategies to improve trial execution and patient engagement.  
- A visual dashboard summarizing all key insights.

------------
Key Findings
------------  
- **Phase II** dominates overall activity, reflecting focus on drug efficacy and safety validation.  
- **Completion rates** show a steady upward trend, interrupted only by short-term global disruptions.  
- **Mayo Clinic** and **Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center** achieved 100% completion rates, while **University of Washington** had higher dropout levels.  
- **Trial duration** typically ranges from 500–2500 days, aligning with Phase II–III cycles.  
- **Recruiting** and **completed** trials make up the bulk of the dataset, suggesting a healthy research pipeline.

--------------
Dataset Source
--------------  
Data was sourced from **[ClinicalTrials.gov](https://clinicaltrials.gov)**, filtered for **oncology** and **interventional** studies conducted in the **U.S.**.  
Variables analyzed include phase, study status, sponsor, intervention type, duration, and completion outcomes.

---------------
Recommendations
---------------  
- Strengthen patient engagement and follow-up mechanisms to reduce dropouts.  
- Provide operational and funding support to smaller sponsors.  
- Increase **Phase IV** (post-marketing) trials for long-term safety data.  
- Use predictive analytics to detect early signs of trial risk.  
- Standardize data collection for better reliability and comparability.
